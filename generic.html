							<p>My name is Jomiloju King (JK). I’m an artificial intelligence enthusiast and computer science student currently pursuing my studies.
								My passion lies in developing innovative technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible. My journey has led me 
								to explore the intersections of machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. </p>
							<p>Through hands-on projects and internships, I've gained valuable experience in crafting artificial intelligence-driven solutions
								that solve complex problems and enhance user engagement. I thrive on challenges and am constantly seeking new opportunities to
								learn, grow, and apply my skills to real-world problems. As I continue my studies, my goal is to become a software engineer, where I 
								can contribute to building cutting-edge technologies. I’m also deeply interested in the ethical implications of artificial intelligence,
								striving to ensure that the technologies I develop are used responsibly and inclusively.</p>
